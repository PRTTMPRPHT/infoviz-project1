This is was the first individual project done for a course in Information Visualization in my master's degree, in 2023.
The assignment was as follows:

<blockquote>
Your task is to design an information visualization system to support the creation of the best possible groups of four or five people for the Final Group Project in your Information Visualization course.
</blockquote>

The data stems from a survey all students took at the beginning of the course. It has been fully anonymized with pseudonyms for publishing on GitHub.
